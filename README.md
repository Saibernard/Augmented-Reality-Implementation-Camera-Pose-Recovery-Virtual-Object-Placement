# Augmented-Reality-Implementation-Camera-Pose-Recovery-Virtual-Object-Placement
This repository dives into augmented reality (AR) by overlaying virtual objects onto a real-world video. Given a video with AprilTags and their coordinates, your goal is two-fold: 1) Determine camera pose using PnP with coplanar assumptions and P3P with the Procrustes problem. 2) Place virtual objects seamlessly in the scene.
